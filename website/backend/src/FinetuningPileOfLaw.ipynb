He was heathy (actually just had a physical). Wednesday night he told his friends he wasn\\u2019t feeling well, (thought he had a fever) he took a shower and said he was feeling better, but he wanted to stay in for the night.\\nThe next day his friend couldn\\u2019t get a hold of him so he had room service let him into my brothers room. They found him there in the floor he was gone. \\nMy family is devastated. His son was on a plane yesterday in the air heading down to DR to spend the weekend with his dad on vacation, only to get off the plane and find out his father was gone. We actually knew about his death before his son did as he was in the air when we found out. \\n\\nSomething is happening down there. I don\\u2019t know if they are poisoning people or if it\\u2019s bad liqueur. \\nI have found articles saying the FBI is investigating so I called and I can\\u2019t get anyone.\\nThey instantly take me to a computer that wants me to choose which investigation I am calling about and the DR deaths are not one of them.\\nI called the embassy and got the run around. \\nMy nephew is still down there \\nThey are taking him to see his dad today.\\nWe just need advice.\\nWe are so lost.\\nWe know we want to get an autopsy, but we don\\u2019t want it done down there by them.\\nAny advise or steps or numbers to call we would definitely appreciate it \\n\\nAlso spoke with two news stations yesterday but no one has gotten back to me today. \\n\\nThank you\\nAnswer #1: You have the right to be suspicious. I'm American but also half Dominican and heard some news about it in the Dominican channel my mom watches. Apparently, people are dying due to the liquor in the hotel (my mom said in Punta Cana). Anyways, so far around 5 or more tourists have died. Here's an article I found that reports the recent death of a woman:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n [https://www.diariolibre.com/actualidad/internacional/muere-otra-turista-en-hotel-de-republica-dominicana-AK13083276](https://www.diariolibre.com/actualidad/internacional/muere-otra-turista-en-hotel-de-republica-dominicana-AK13083276) \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe article states that she went to DR to vacation alone and was found dead in her hotel room (similar to your brother in law). According to this article, the officials at the US Embassy said she died of a heart attack, however, her son is suspicious. I'm sure your brother's case is not an isolated incident and people are possibly dying from the bad liquor.Answer #2: You said you contacted Cory Booker for help, but you should be aware that he is running for President, so I'm not sure constituent services would be top priority for his office right now, especially since you'll need action done in a couple days. Contact Bob Menendez's office as well, and also contact your Congressperson. They may be faster to respond that either of the Senators.Answer #3: The consensus is that they are spraying the rooms with pesticides for bedbugs that causes heart attacks and pulmonary edema in humans.Answer #4: Just a tip- check with his health insurance. Many of them are offering free access to specialists who deal with medical care in other countries, and repatriation of remains is a surprisingly common activity for them.Answer #5: A friend of my family died internationally over 10 years ago. I remember it being INCREDIBLY expensive and time consuming to get them to ship his remains back. Something with US customs rarely allows bodies to be transported back to the states and most frequently they demand to cremate the body before returning it to the family AFAIK. You need a lawyer YESTERDAY to get working on this - call the NJ Bar Association to find one who can help.Answer #6: Yeah, don't drink from the mini barAnswer #7: OP mentioned that the deceased was staying at the Terra Linda in Sos\\u00faa. I've stayed there several times over the years, although not recently, so things may have changed.\\n\\n\\nThe TL, like most Sos\\u00faa hotels, is a small, independent hotel. It is not a large all-inclusive resort.  To my recollection, the TL did not have an in room bar.\\n\\nThat's not to say that the deceased was not in some way victimized. Given the nature of Sos\\u00faa tourism, I can think of quite a few ways this could happen. I leave the research as an exercise for the reader.\\n\\nThe situation in Sos\\u00faa and the north coast generally is very different from the huge Punta Cana and south coast AI resorts. As such, this incident may have a different cause.Answer #8: After doing more research, nobody should be going to the Dominican Republic unit this shit is sorted out.  Spread the word.Answer #9: I\\u2019ve also noticed the uptick in attacks and deaths in the DR. Won\\u2019t be heading there.Answer #10: INAL and I'm sorry for your loss and the situation you are going through; just so you know I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic but I will do my best to offer you the best advice that I can.  I understand about your concern about an autopsy being performed in the D.R., but that is the standard procedure and you will not be able to stop it.  If anything doesn't look right you should focus your efforts in trying to get another autopsy and toxicology done by an specialist that you trust.\\n\\nHave you contacted the U.S. Citizens Services section at the embassy? Their number is (809) 567-7775 and they are tasked with assisting relatives with the disposition of loved one's remains, which I assume includes repatriation.  Make sure to get the [Consular Report of Death Abroad](https://do.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/281/2017/01/80018.pdf), which will be needed to settle legal matters.   [Here's information on the U.S. State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/death-abroad1/return-of-remains-of-deceased-us-citizen.html) on what is the process to repatriate your brother's remains.\\n\\nIt seems that either you or someone from your family will have to spend a few days in the Dominican Republic; if you need assistance from expatriates living there I can recommend the forum in [www.dr1.com](https://www.dr1.com).  There are lots of Americans and Canadians living around the Puerto Plata area (where Sosua is) and I'm sure that they will be happy to assist and provide advice on how to deal with the authorities over there.Answer #11: I read in a different reddit thread that tourists are being poisoned by a heavy chemical they use to treat bed bugs at hotels and resorts.Answer #12: My family &amp; I were in the DR in January. While there my son (5 years old) got very ill. I figured he had the flu despite having had his flu shot but no one else got sick. I kind of wonder now if he did, in fact, have the flu or if we got very lucky.\\n\\nOP, I am so sorry for what you are going through. I hope you all get some answers &amp; some kind of closure. I can nit even fathom how you all must be feeling.Answer #13: JFC, I just started googling \\\"Dominican Rebulic tourist death\\\" and the results legit scared me. WTF are they doing down there... I'm sorry for your loss.\",\n          \"Title: [NJ] Can campus police issue vehicle moving violation tickets?\\nQuestion:I'm a commuter at a state university that has a big campus police force because we are in the heart of Newark basically. I've been pulled over twice by the campus police while driving but I've never been issued a ticket. The first time was when I failed to stop at a crosswalk for someone who was waiting at the corner...it was on a busy street so stopping wasn't ideal, but no ticket. Second time happened today when I accidentally ran a red while looking for parking on the streets, thankfully no one was hurt because it wasn't busy but they pulled me over understandably and I was ready with all my documents. Still didn't get a ticket and only a verbal warning...I really expected to get a ticket today cause that would have been dangerous if it was busy then. \\n\\nSo then my question are: can campus police issue moving violation tickets? And both times they did take my drivers and registration back to their cars so do verbal warnings go on record?\\nAnswer #1: Yes and Yes.

Here's an article I found that reports the recent death of a woman:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n [https://www.diariolibre.com/actualidad/internacional/muere-otra-turista-en-hotel-de-republica-dominicana-AK13083276](https://www.diariolibre.com/actualidad/internacional/muere-otra-turista-en-hotel-de-republica-dominicana-AK13083276) \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe article states that she went to DR to vacation alone and was found dead in her hotel room (similar to your brother in law). According to this article, the officials at the US Embassy said she died of a heart attack, however, her son is suspicious. I'm sure your brother's case is not an isolated incident and people are possibly dying from the bad liquor.Answer #2: You said you contacted Cory Booker for help, but you should be aware that he is running for President, so I'm not sure constituent services would be top priority for his office right now, especially since you'll need action done in a couple days. Contact Bob Menendez's office as well, and also contact your Congressperson. They may be faster to respond that either of the Senators.Answer #3: The consensus is that they are spraying the rooms with pesticides for bedbugs that causes heart attacks and pulmonary edema in humans.Answer #4: Just a tip- check with his health insurance. Many of them are offering free access to specialists who deal with medical care in other countries, and repatriation of remains is a surprisingly common activity for them.Answer #5: A friend of my family died internationally over 10 years ago. I remember it being INCREDIBLY expensive and time consuming to get them to ship his remains back. Something with US customs rarely allows bodies to be transported back to the states and most frequently they demand to cremate the body before returning it to the family AFAIK. You need a lawyer YESTERDAY to get working on this - call the NJ Bar Association to find one who can help.Answer #6: Yeah, don't drink from the mini barAnswer #7: OP mentioned that the deceased was staying at the Terra Linda in Sos\\u00faa. I've stayed there several times over the years, although not recently, so things may have changed.\\n\\n\\nThe TL, like most Sos\\u00faa hotels, is a small, independent hotel. It is not a large all-inclusive resort.  To my recollection, the TL did not have an in room bar.\\n\\nThat's not to say that the deceased was not in some way victimized. Given the nature of Sos\\u00faa tourism, I can think of quite a few ways this could happen. I leave the research as an exercise for the reader.\\n\\nThe situation in Sos\\u00faa and the north coast generally is very different from the huge Punta Cana and south coast AI resorts. As such, this incident may have a different cause.Answer #8: After doing more research, nobody should be going to the Dominican Republic unit this shit is sorted out.  Spread the word.Answer #9: I\\u2019ve also noticed the uptick in attacks and deaths in the DR. Won\\u2019t be heading there.Answer #10: INAL and I'm sorry for your loss and the situation you are going through; just so you know I was born and raised in the Dominican Republic but I will do my best to offer you the best advice that I can.  I understand about your concern about an autopsy being performed in the D.R., but that is the standard procedure and you will not be able to stop it.  If anything doesn't look right you should focus your efforts in trying to get another autopsy and toxicology done by an specialist that you trust.\\n\\nHave you contacted the U.S. Citizens Services section at the embassy? Their number is (809) 567-7775 and they are tasked with assisting relatives with the disposition of loved one's remains, which I assume includes repatriation.  Make sure to get the [Consular Report of Death Abroad](https://do.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/281/2017/01/80018.pdf), which will be needed to settle legal matters.   [Here's information on the U.S. State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/death-abroad1/return-of-remains-of-deceased-us-citizen.html) on what is the process to repatriate your brother's remains.\\n\\nIt seems that either you or someone from your family will have to spend a few days in the Dominican Republic; if you need assistance from expatriates living there I can recommend the forum in [www.dr1.com](https://www.dr1.com).  There are lots of Americans and Canadians living around the Puerto Plata area (where Sosua is) and I'm sure that they will be happy to assist and provide advice on how to deal with the authorities over there.Answer #11: I read in a different reddit thread that tourists are being poisoned by a heavy chemical they use to treat bed bugs at hotels and resorts.Answer #12: My family &amp; I were in the DR in January. While there my son (5 years old) got very ill. I figured he had the flu despite having had his flu shot but no one else got sick. I kind of wonder now if he did, in fact, have the flu or if we got very lucky.\\n\\nOP, I am so sorry for what you are going through. I hope you all get some answers &amp; some kind of closure. I can nit even fathom how you all must be feeling.Answer #13: JFC, I just started googling \\\"Dominican Rebulic tourist death\\\" and the results legit scared me. WTF are they doing down there... I'm sorry for your loss.\",\n          \"[NJ] Can campus police issue vehicle moving violation tickets?\\nQuestion:I'm a commuter at a state university that has a big campus police force because we are in the heart of Newark basically. I've been pulled over twice by the campus police while driving but I've never been issued a ticket. The first time was when I failed to stop at a crosswalk for someone who was waiting at the corner...it was on a busy street so stopping wasn't ideal, but no ticket. Second time happened today when I accidentally ran a red while looking for parking on the streets, thankfully no one was hurt because it wasn't busy but they pulled me over understandably and I was ready with all my documents. Still didn't get a ticket and only a verbal warning...I really expected to get a ticket today cause that would have been dangerous if it was busy then. \\n\\nSo then my question are: can campus police issue moving violation tickets? And both times they did take my drivers and registration back to their cars so do verbal warnings go on record?\\nAnswer #1: Yes and Yes. Most campus police are sworn peace officers and can write you up.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35049,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"&gt; according to my SIL, I can just go to VA and get my Benzodiazpines refilled anytime I want and I don't pay for them anyway and she does through her tax dollars so it was okay to take them.\\n\\nThe police would not agree to this point-of-view to whom a call would be warranted.\\n\\n&gt; What are my options to have some sort of power of attorney placed in my wife's name for my MIL health care? \\n\\nYou would need to get a family law attorney and have him/her petitiion the court. More importantly, you need to involve Adult Protective Services to get your MIL away from your SIL. Not only is what she's doing illegal, but it is incredibly dangerous. APS will also help with the process.Answer #2: This is way illegal. Report this to the police right freaking now if you care about this woman at all. SIL may go to prison. Mom needs to be seen by a real doctor immediately. These meds could be doing serious long term damage. Answer #3: Your sister-in-law stole controlled substances, is illegally in possession of controlled substances, and is poisoning her mother's food with them, plus probably committing elder abuse or abuse of a vulnerable person. She's looking at serious criminal charges when you bring this to police attention - which you may need to do, if you plan on keeping your prescriptions for controlled medications.\\n\\n_Do not provide any further medication to anyone involved_ and keep meticulous track of your own meds until this is sorted out. Put them in a locked box and keep the key on your person. \\\"Her tax dollars\\\" does not give your sister-in-law a right to take your meds. If your wife was involved, then you need to lock her out of your meds, too.\\n\\nIf your mother-in-law is lucid enough, your wife should probably sit her down and talk about this situation with her. She has a moral right to know what happened to her and what her daughter did and to decide how to respond. She _should_ talk to her own doctor about this, immediately, so that her doctor is aware of what happened and can help her compensate for the unexpected medications. If she's not competent to make her own medical decisions, your wife can look into suing for guardianship, which would allow her to make medical decisions on her mother's behalf, but if she is competent, she's allowed to refuse help.Answer #4: Power of attorney allows you to act on your mom's behalf legally.\\n\\nBut your mom is still allowed to act for herself legally, too.\\n\\nYou need to have her declared incompetent and appointed her guardian if you want her to not be able to act for herself.\\n\\nThat will involve court hearings where she (and presumably your sister-in-law) could fight it.\\n\\nAside from that, your SIL is committing numerous felonies, including theft, possession, and distribution of illegal drugs and possible elder abuse.\",\n          \"Yes, it\\u2019s perfectly legal to ask for photo ID from someone using a credit card.\",\n          \"This is a great question to ask your lawyer, really you made a pretty mess out of the situation and by this time (if I was in your position) I would talk to a realestate attorney.Answer #2: Oof! Did you already waive the finance contingency, too? That's usually the golden \\\"out\\\".\\n\\nShe can't really stop you from buying the dream home; although I would close sooner rather than later on the dream home since if she sues you there is a chance it'll spook the underwriter. Again, the odds of this are small. \\n\\nOther than that, the two contracts are not related. Answer #3: Your answer is in the contract. What are the options and penalties for breaking it? You already asked the homeowner and they refused to even accept money.\\n\\nDo you have enough money to buy both homes and hold the first until you sell it? Because that would probably be cheaper than a lawsuit, which you could quite possibly lose. Then you are stuck paying for not only a house, but your lawyer and probably their lawyer fees.Answer #4: The other posters have addressed your question on getting out of the first contract so I'll suggest something else to consider:\\n\\nYou said your original plan was to eventually rent this out - why not go through with the sale and begin renting House 1 as an income property?Answer #5: I keep wondering what's wrong with house #1 that they are trying so hard to force the sale. You've already offered $5k cash plus them keeping earnest money, but they are willing to leave that plus pay attorneys to sue you, over a $100k house. \\n\\nSeems a little fishy to me.Answer #6: How's the market? If the seller ends of getting it sold for a higher price, there's no damages, except maybe extra costs due to having to sell it twice. If they sell it for a lower price than the contract, you could be liable for the difference and possibly attorney's fees.\\n\\nSpecific performance is unlikely since money damages would would repair the breach. \\n\\nIf she doesn't try to sell it to someone else, the phrase \\\"failure to mitigate\\\" will be your best friend.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
