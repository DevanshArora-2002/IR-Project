I have been working for a company for about a year and a half. The company is based in the US and I work from home. My company pays me a salary and pays taxes on it. However, I also receive a commission for sales. This commission is calculated based on the sales I make. For example, if I sell a product for $500, then I get a $200 commission. If I do not sell the product, or if the sale is less than $400, my commission goes down to $150. So, for example if a sale was $300, it would be $75 in commission, $25 in salary, $50 in taxes, etc. Basically, this company has a system where they pay me based off of the amount of sales they make,\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"query3 = \"My friend is refusing to return money what should I do?\"\ntop_results3 = calculate_bm25_scores(chunked_data,query3,[10])\nprompt3 = prompt_generation(top_results3,query3)\ngenerated_text3 = generate_text(prompt3,tokenizer,model)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-08T11:52:40.234698Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-08T11:52:40.235083Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-08T11:52:48.461119Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-08T11:52:40.235053Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-08T11:52:48.460329Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":68,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Both `max_new_tokens` (=250) and `max_length`(=250) seem to have been set. `max_new_tokens` will take precedence.

What can I expect?\nQuestion:I dated this girl for a year and a half. We broke up in May and she has been harassing me ever since. She has threatened to call the police on me, to have me arrested, etc. I have blocked her on everything and have not responded to any of her messages. Today she messaged me on Facebook and said that she was going to file a police report against me and that I was a danger to her and her family. This is all in response to me telling her that we were done and I would never contact her again. Is there anything I can do to protect myself from this? I am in California\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
